				        This EFCA snapshot is based off the <a href="https://go.efca.org/resources/document/efca-annual-church-metrics-survey">Annual Church Metrics Survey</a> and data collected from our various departments and missions fields. It is designed to measure our faithfulness in alignment with EFCA missions and vision. You'll find a current look at our churches, the broader EFCA movement and many reasons why we celebrate the fruitfulness that comes from God!

Kompelien further developed partnerships between districts and like-minded ministries around the world, allowing the gospel to take priority over denominational identity.<p>As we said hello to a new president, we said grateful goodbyes to two former executive leaders. On March 9, Dr. Thomas McDill, the third president of the EFCA, passed away after a battle with lung cancer and Robert C. Dillon, former executive director of the EFCA's international mission, went to be with the Lord on April 16. We thank God for His legacy of leadership provided to the EFCA movement.</p>">

To help church leaders become more fluent in talking about work and the economy, <a href=&quot;https://go.efca.org/ministries/office-president/faith-work-and-economics&quot;>we can help organize grants</a> to EFCA pastors and lay leaders to help deepen their understanding while funding the implementation of ideas that will shape churches and bless communities.">

We embrace and celebrate what has been accomplished thus far and must continue to make it a priority. The opportunity for tremendous growth in this area remains. 17.5 percent of churches report they are multiethnic, which is consistent with last yearâ€™s data. A church is considered multiethnic if 20 percent or more of attendees are of a second ethnicity than the majority.">

To better accomplish the EFCA mission and vision, we must further emphasize measuring and adapting what we do for greater effectiveness. Currently, 67 percent of churches report having a leadership development plan and a disciplemaking plan. With God's leading, the EFCA national office and districts must work together to provide coaching, networking, learning cohorts and resources to promote fruitfulness.<p>Fewer than 60 percent of churches are engaged in apprenticeship. This gap signals one of the greatest opportunities to enhance existing leadership development plans. We must place a high priority on helping national leaders, district leaders, pastors and lay leaders embrace the relational and practical benefits of creating an apprenticeship culture.">

In addition, 33 percent of churches faithfully support a church plant and 22 percent plan to plant a church. Traditionally, EFCA churches have a 3 percent annual church planting rate, so recent church reporting shows an opportunity for growth and optimism. Our goal is to see an 8 percent reproduction rate in EFCA churches.">
